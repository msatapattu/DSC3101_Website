This course will help enhance their technical knowledge through laboratory sessions. The content of this course mainly covers the theoretical concepts such as Statistical Simulation Methods, Multivariate Data Analysis, Nonparametric Statistical Inference and Categorical Data Analysis. It also includes some practical sessions where students learn how to use more recent R packages for complex data manipulation and creating academic documents.\n\n\n\n\nNot to become an expert in all statistical software packages but to become an expert data scientist\nIdentify appropriate software packages available for advanced statistical data analysis techniques.\nApply the advanced statistical methods in practice and interpret the results.\nPerform a comprehensive statistical analysis, and compile and self publish a scientific report.\nSelf-explore the software tools available for statistical data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.Â Malima Atapattu, Department of Statistics & Computer Science, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka."
